In this project I'll be recreating React components from Semantic UI, ReactBootstrap, and a few other sites just to see if I can do it. I've found that opting to not use these outside components has actually saved me a lot of time and hassle in the past, so I'm looking forward to having a repo set aside for myself that has unbroken code that wasn't written in 2018. No promises that I'm going to wow you, but I hope that what I'm able to produce is helpful to someone, someday.

If anyone at any point has any notes on things that seem broken or better ways that I can achieve certain affects I am more than happy to hear you out. We're all learning every single day so any and all constructive input is appreciated!

***Just to keep things clear: I'm in no way implying that I'm better, or more talented than the people who built the components in the libraries I mentioned. I'm a novice and I'm very aware that they know what they're doing far better than I do.***
